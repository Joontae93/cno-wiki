# Adding Content ✍️

## File Types (aka Using MDX)

Since we're a dev team, it is a fair assumption that we'll often be sharing code solutions or snippets with each other. To that end, using a `.mdx` file instead of a pure markdown file (`.md`) will allow us one clean trick: copiable code snippets! After the frontmatter (see below), import a CodeBlock component with `import CodeBlock from 'relative/path/to/components/CodeBlock.astro` and you'll then be able to use the CodeBlock snippet throughout your MDX file.

The `<CodeBlock />` component takes two properties: `language` and `codeBlock`. Both properties are strings, and if you're using VS Code, you'll get intelligent hints about which languages you can use. 
```typescript
Props {
	language: 'js' | 'scss' | 'php' | 'html' | 'md';
	codeBlock: string;
}
```

When adding the string to the `codeBlock` prop, use the following syntax: `codeBlock={your_code_inside_the_back_ticks}`. If you'd simply like to add a code block (but **not**have it copyable, you can use Markdown's triple-backtick expression. You can also add a language hint immediately after the first 3 backticks to have Astro auto-highlight your syntax. For example,
<CodeBlock
					language="php"
					codeBlock={`
					\`\`\`php
					function your_php_here() {
						$is_formatted = true;
						return is_formatted;
					}
					\`\`\`
					`}/>
				 parses out to 
				 ```php
function your_php_here() {
  $is_formatted = true;
  return is_formatted;
}
```

## Adding New Content

To add content to the blog, drop some markdown files to `/src/content/blog/wherever-makes-logical-sense` and push the commit.

All markdown files are looking for the following frontmatter (dropped between opening & closing triple hyphens):

```markdown
