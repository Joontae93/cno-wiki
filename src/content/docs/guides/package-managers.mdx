## Overview

Package managers like npm ðŸ‘¾ and Composer ðŸŽ¼ help us manage project dependencies without adding a ton of extra "noise" to a repo or production environment.

We are able to define project dependencies (things a project needs to survive) and developer dependencies (things a developer needs to survive but are not required by the project) quickly, manage version control for these libraries, and share only _our_ code where it's needed.

## Composer ðŸŽ¼

Assuming you've got homebrew and php installed, let's take a look at installing Composer!

**Quick Start:**

1. Install Composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
2. Migrate it to your $PATH with `sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`
3. It's ready to be called with `composer` in your command line!

## npm ðŸ‘¾

Assuming you've got [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed, installing npm is quick and easy.

**An Even Quicker Start:**

0. Check your engines with `node -v` and `npm -v`
1. Run `npm install -g npm`

That's it!

## Getting Started

Once you've got it installed, you can run `composer init` if you're starting a new project to set up your `composer.json` file. If that file already exists, simply run `composer install` and `composer update` to install what you need. Similarly, run `npm init` to create your `package.json` file.
