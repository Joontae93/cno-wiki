## An Overview

It's very easy for the root of a project to get messy. Here's a quick guide on where to put stuff, where to look, and just general file organization. For simple point-of-reference, we'll use the [CNO Starter Theme](https://github.com/choctaw-nation/cno-template-theme) as a guide.

<QuickTip title="Aside">

    - This guide is meant strictly as a _guide_ and does not take steps to
    declare folder structure beyond what is outline in this document.
    - _Btw, the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) makes your VS Code folders look pretty if you're into that._

</QuickTip>

Okay, that being said, let's take a look! The _Repo Root_ is what you should open in VS Code, and is where all of your config files will live. In a Local WP install, it's located at `[Local Sites]/[site-name]/app/public` (assuming your local sites live in a directory called "Local Sites").

## Repo Root (/public/)

-   Config Files
    -   package.json (+ auto-generated lock)
    -   composer.json (+ auto-generated lock)
    -   auth.json
        -   Used to install ACF Pro w/ Composer
    -   webpack.config.js
        -   Needs some tooling
    -   .gitignore
        -   Also might need some tooling
    -   readme.md
-   Also will include deletable folders (which should not be uploaded to version control):
    -   node_modules (auto-generated by npm)
    -   vendor (auto-generated by composer)

# Project Root

Located `wp-content/themes/[starter-theme]/`

The Tree:

```
| theme/
|--> dist/
|--> inc/
|--> src/
|----> src/styles
|----> src/js
|--> templates/
|--> style.css
|--> screenshot.png
|--> ...(index.php)
```

## /dist (Distribution)

-   Generated by Webpack when running `npm run start/build` script.
    -   In the wild, it may also be referred to as the `build` folder (which is the default directory name config'd by `@wordpress/scripts`).
-   When enqueuing scripts/style sheets, make sure you point here (and _not_ your `/src` directory).

## /src (Source)

`index.js` for global imports.

A typical top of the file will contain
`import './styles/main.scss'` which tells Webpack to parse and bundle `main.scss`

### /src/js

Here, we can generate individual JS folders. For example, in the [cno-careers theme](https://github.com/choctaw-nation/cno-careers/tree/master/wp-content/themes/cno-careers-v2/src/js), I've added `how-to-apply` and `jobs` folders inside my `/src/js` folder. There is also a `bsImports.js` file that allows me to import the necessary Bootstrap functionality when needed.

<QuickTip title="Another Aside">
	The following is ‚Äústrongly suggested‚Äù territory. It's not required, but
	you'll see the benefit of using this type of architecture based on how
	Webpack and my `enqueue_page_assets()` php üêò function are configured.
</QuickTip>

#### A Real-World Example

```
.../src/js
|--> how-to-apply/
|----> Presentational/
|------> Steps.jsx
|----> App.jsx
|--> jobs/
|----> App.jsx
|--> bsImports.js
```

Inside of each folder is an `App.jsx` which acts as that directory's `index.js`, responsible for loading the component's scss üíÑ as well as any other JS modules.

<QuickTip title="About 'App.jsx'">

    1. This is a standard naming convention for React apps. `JSX` is an
    open-source file type that is not glued to the React framework.
    2. [Webpack](/cno-wiki/docs/guides/webpack-config) is looking inside of subdirectories for a file named 'App.jsx', so it's
    worth starting with this file to begin with (unless you're writing vanilla JS and the file type needs be `.js`).

### Styles (7-1 SCSS Folder)

While not all of my projects have need for a full [7-1 architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern) pattern, it's still a good mental model to use. Typically (as in our starter theme), you'll only need the following folders:

-   /abstracts
-   /base
-   /components
-   /pages
-   /vendors

Use the following CLI to generate these folders in go (assuming your CLI is in `/src/styles`):

<CodeBlock
	language="md"
	codeBlock={`
mkdir {abstracts,base,components,pages,vendors}`}
/>

**Abstracts** contain Sass things: `_variables.scss`, `_functions.scss`, and/or `_mixins.scss`.

**Base** is the container for all global things (e.g. `_typography.scss` or `reset.scss`), where you might define element level settings. For example:

<CodeBlock
	language="scss"
	codeBlock={`
html { 
    // set 1rem to 10px while maintaining accessibility
    font-size: 62.5%;

    body {
        font-size: 1.6rem;
    }

}`}
/>

**Components** holds things like Navbar styles, Header styles, Button styles, etc.

<QuickTip title="Sass Partials">

    - [The official Sass Docs](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4) say partials should be named with a leading underscore (e.g. `_header.scss`).
    - Inside of the `/pages` subdirectory, they should all contain the page name in snake case (e.g. `page-name.scss`) for quick use with [Webpack.config](/cno-wiki/docs/guides/webpack-config).

</QuickTip>

**Pages**
The exception to the partials naming convention, files inside of this directory should mirror their JS folder partners' names and should not have a leading underscore. These essentially act as a page's `style.css` sheet for code-splitting later on.

**Vendors**
Where you can drop any vendor styles, namely Bootstrap custom scss files.

<mark>
	_Exception! I typically import fonts in `_typography.scss` for tight
	integration. If someone wanted to fight me on that, they would find I made a
	pretty weak opponent._
</mark>

## /inc (Includes)

This is where I would put any `class-*.php` files (e.g. `class-components.php`) or custom post-type/taxonomy definitions (in their own file). I might also make a folder inside of here called `plugins-functions` that contains files like `gravity-forms.php` or `/search-and-filter-templates`&mdash;assuming the plugins allow you to do so.

## /templates

WP Template files.

-   `page-[name].php`
-   `single-[name].php`
-   `archive-[name].php`
-   `content-[name].php`

## Everything Else

Probably a lot of php üêò files, but hopefully not too many.
Also, `screenshot.png` & `style.css`
